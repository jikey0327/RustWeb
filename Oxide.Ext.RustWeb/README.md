RustWeb for Oxide 2
===================
The Oxide 2 glue for RustWeb.

Installation
------------
1. Stop the server
2. If you used RustMap before, **delete** "Oxide.Ext.RustMap.dll" from "RustDedicated_Data\Managed"
3. Copy "dcodeIO.RustWeb.dll" and "Oxide.Ext.RustWeb.dll" to "RustDedicated_Data\Managed\"
4. Copy the folder "www" next to (not inside of) Oxide's "data" directory (located at "server\data" by default, in this case "www" goes to "server\www")
5. Restart the server
6. Make sure that your firewall allows TCP requests on your gameserver's port
